<p style="font-size:20px; ">
Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers among women worldwide and the major
contributor to the global cancer morbidity. According to the WHO data, in 2022, breast cancer ranked
second in overall incidence and remained the most common cause of cancer death in women. In the
United States specifically, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women, only
after lung cancer (CDC, 2025).<br>
This project performs exploratory data analysis on breast cancer cell data to identify patterns and features related to malignant vs. benign tumors using Python visualizations and statistical techniques.<br>
<b>Our goals are to:</b><br>
a) Quantify how malignancy rates vary with age and tumor characteristics<br>
b)​ Identify which features most strongly distinguish malignant from benign tumors<br>
c)​ Visualize trends with distribution plots and partial dependence views<br>
